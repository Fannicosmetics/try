<p class="exp" > 	            The Wonder browse the latest szemöldökdúsítási process, which is due to incomplete or rare<br>
													szemöldökből natural, lush eyebrows formatted..<br>
													<br>
										I recommend to those who are deficient because of the eyebrows or a natural condition or  <br>
										disease and those who are averse to szemöldöktetoválástól, szőrbeültetéstől and other <br>
										permanent interference.<br>
										<br/>
										The procedure can be performed in two techniques can be combined with each other or the <br>
										two techniques. One of the lash enrichment technique, when mounting a thin silk yarns are <br>
										the eyebrows, enriched with the effect, the other is the staining technique, thin fibers which  <br>
										are drawn between the eyebrows of a special paint. The two methods can be combined with  <br>
										one another as needed. <br>
										<br>
										Both methodologies 2-3 weeks, depending on the durability, skin zsírosodásától, the existing <br> 
										amount of fibers and the avoidance of external influences.<br> 
										<br>
										It must be avoided for 24 hours after enrichment eyebrow contact with water, and <br> 
										subsequently the sauna, and chlorinated water because they reduce the durability of fibers.<br> 
										<br>
										I would like to fuller eyebrows, look at the price!<br>
